The Python script comprises two files: buying_signal.py and post_grabber_linkedin.py. These files collectively automate the process of logging into a LinkedIn account and searching for specific keywords within the knowledge graph, facilitating efficient data retrieval for targeted information.

The script utilizes Selenium, a powerful automation tool, to simulate user interactions and automate the login process to a LinkedIn account. This ensures seamless access to LinkedIn's platform, enabling subsequent data extraction tasks.

After successful authentication, the script proceeds to perform keyword searches within LinkedIn's knowledge graph. This feature enables users to specify relevant keywords or phrases, allowing the script to retrieve pertinent information related to those terms.

Upon identifying relevant posts or information within the knowledge graph, the script extracts and compiles the data for further analysis or processing. This streamlined approach saves time and effort by automating the tedious task of manual data extraction.



Before executing the script, users need to ensure that appropriate configurations are set within the post_grabber_linkedin.py file. This may include specifying the LinkedIn account credentials, desired keywords for search, and any other relevant parameters.

To initiate the web scraping process, simply execute the post_grabber_linkedin.py script. The automation process will commence, sequentially logging into the LinkedIn account and performing keyword searches as per the specified criteria.

The script generates output containing the extracted data, which can be further processed, analyzed, or stored as required. Users can customize the output format or destination based on their preferences and use case.
